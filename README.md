# Chapter 6 . Basics of Loops and the for Loop in C

- A **for loop** is a fundamental control structure in C used to repeat a set of instructions a specific number of times.
- It is ideal when the number of repetitions is known before the loop starts.
- The for loop consists of three main parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
- The loop begins with initialization, checks the condition before each iteration, and updates the loop variable after each cycle.
- The process continues until the condition becomes false.
- The for loop is commonly used for tasks such as counting, iterating through arrays, or performing repetitive calculations.
- It is preferred over other loops (like while or do-while) when the number of iterations is predetermined.
