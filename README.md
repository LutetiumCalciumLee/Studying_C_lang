# Chapter 13 . LECTURE NOTE on PROGRAMMING in C

## Overview

The document provides a thorough introduction to the C programming language, covering its history, structure, syntax, core features, and practical programming concepts. It is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of C.

## Key Topics Covered

- **History and Purpose:**  
  C was originally developed for programming the UNIX operating system and is now widely used for system and application software development.

- **Structure of a C Program:**  
  A C program typically includes preprocessor directives, a main function, variable declarations, executable statements, and (optionally) user-defined functions. Each statement ends with a semicolon.

- **Compilation and Execution:**  
  The process involves writing source code in a text editor, saving it with a `.c` extension, compiling it using a C compiler, and executing the resulting program. The compiler checks for syntax errors, and the execution phase may reveal runtime or logical errors.

- **Character Set, Identifiers, Keywords, Constants, Variables:**  
  C uses a defined set of characters, reserved keywords, and rules for naming identifiers. Variables must be declared with a type before use.

- **Expressions and Operators:**  
  C supports various operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, conditional, bitwise, and special operators) and follows precedence and associativity rules for evaluating expressions.

- **Control Structures:**  
  Includes decision-making statements (`if`, `if-else`, nested `if`, `switch-case`) and looping constructs (`while`, `do-while`, `for`, with `break` and `continue`).

- **Arrays:**  
  C supports single and multi-dimensional arrays for storing collections of data. Arrays are indexed from zero, and their size must be specified at declaration.

- **Pointers:**  
  Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. The document covers pointer declaration, pointer arithmetic, passing pointers to functions, and the relationship between pointers and arrays.

- **Functions:**  
  Functions promote modularity and code reuse. The document explains function declaration, definition, calling, parameter passing (by value and by reference), and recursion.

- **Structures and Unions:**  
  Structures allow grouping of variables of different types under a single name. Unions are similar but use shared memory for all members.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**  
  Functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` are used to allocate and manage memory at runtime.

- **File Handling:**  
  C provides functions for file input/output, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

## Practical Aspects

- The document includes sample code snippets, explanations of syntax, and step-by-step guides for compiling and running C programs.
- Common errors (syntax, runtime, logical) are discussed, with tips for debugging.
- Emphasis is placed on good programming practices, such as clear naming, modular code, and proper memory management.
