# Chapter 1 . Understanding the C Language and Installing a Compiler

## What is the C Language?

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language for creating various types of software, including word processors, spreadsheets, games, and mobile apps.

Developed by computer programmers, C is used for everything from simple calculators to complex applications.

## Main Areas of Use

- PC and mobile application development
- System programming
- Embedded systems
- Languages such as **C**, **C++**, and **C#** are commonly used in these fields

## Features of the C Language

- **Portability:**  
  Code written in C can run on various operating systems, such as Windows and Unix.

- **Hardware Accessibility:**  
  Allows low-level access, making it suitable for system programming.

- **Simple Syntax:**  
  Clear and straightforward syntax makes C easy to learn.

- **Extensibility:**  
  Learning C makes it easier to pick up most other programming languages.


## How to Write and Run a C Program

### 1. Program Coding
- Coding means writing instructions in a format that the C compiler can understand and process.
- The initial code is written in a way that only humans can understand.

### 2. Compilation and Linking
- **Compilation:** Converts the human-readable source file into a machine-readable object file that the computer can understand.
- **Linking:** Combines multiple object files into a single executable file.

### 3. Program Execution
- The generated executable file (.exe) can be run to see the program's output.

### âš¡ Build Process Summary

- **Build = Compilation + Linking**
- Even if there is only one source file, both compilation and linking must be performed.
- Most compilers handle both steps together, so the entire process is often called "build."
- In some cases, compilation and linking can be done separately if needed.

## Project Environment

- I created the C language files using **Visual Studio**.
