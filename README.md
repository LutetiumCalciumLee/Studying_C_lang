# Chapter 3 . printf Function and Formatted Input/Output in C

- **printf** is a standard C library function used to output formatted text to the screen.
- The function takes a *format string* (which may include plain text and format specifiers starting with `%`) and a variable number of arguments to print.
- Format specifiers, such as `%d` for integers, `%s` for strings, `%f` for floating-point numbers, and `%c` for characters, determine how each value is displayed in the output.
- The format string can also include options for width, precision, and flags to control alignment, padding, and formatting details
- To use `printf`, include the header file `#include ` at the top of your program.
- The related function `scanf` is used for formatted input, allowing users to enter values in a specified format.
- Advanced formatting options allow for dynamic width and precision using asterisks (`*`) in the format string, with values provided as additional arguments.
