# Chapter 4 . Understanding C Operators

## Overview of C Operators
- Operators are symbols used to perform various operations such as calculations, comparisons, and logical evaluations on data.
- Operands are the variables or values that operators act upon.
- C provides various types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, conditional, bitwise, and special operators.

## Main Types and Features
- **Arithmetic Operators :** +, -, *, /, % perform basic mathematical operations. The % operator is only used with integers.
- **Relational Operators :** >, =, <=, ==, != compare two values and return 1 (true) or 0 (false). In C, any nonzero value is considered true.
- **Logical Operators :** && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT) perform logical operations.
- **Assignment Operators :** =, +=, -=, etc. assign or update values in variables. = is assignment, == is comparison.
- **Increment/Decrement Operators :** ++, -- increase or decrease a variable by 1. The effect differs depending on whether they are used before or after the variable.
- **Conditional Operator :** (condition) ? true : false selects a value based on a condition.
- **Bitwise Operators :** Used for bit-level operations, often in hardware-related programming.

## Operator Precedence and Associativity
- When multiple operators are used in an expression, precedence and associativity determine the order of evaluation.
- Among arithmetic operators, *, /, % have higher precedence than + and -.
